    <p> The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera, native to Africa and India. It has a muscular,
        broad-chested body; a short, rounded head; round ears; and a dark, hairy tuft at the tip of its tail. It is
        sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane. It is a social species,
        forming groups called prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs. Groups of
        female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on medium-sized and large ungulates. The lion is an apex and
        keystone predator; although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans,
        lions typically do not actively seek out and prey on humans.</p>

    <p> Elephants are the largest living land animals. Three living species are currently recognised: the African bush
        elephant (Loxodonta africana), the African forest elephant (L. cyclotis), and the Asian elephant (Elephas
        maximus). They are the only surviving members of the family Elephantidae and the order Proboscidea; extinct
        relatives include mammoths and mastodons. Distinctive features of elephants include a long proboscis called a
        trunk, tusks, large ear flaps, pillar-like legs, and tough but sensitive grey skin. The trunk is prehensile,
        bringing food and water to the mouth and grasping objects. Tusks, which are derived from the incisor teeth,
        serve both as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. The large ear flaps assist in maintaining a
        constant body temperature as well as in communication. African elephants have larger ears and concave backs,
        whereas Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs</p>
