            <p><strong>Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin[f]</strong> (born Dzhugashvili;[g] 18 December [O.S. 6 December]
                1878 – 5 March 1953) was a Soviet politician and revolutionary who led the Soviet Union from 1924 until
                his death in 1953. He held power as General Secretary of the Communist Party from 1922 to 1952 and as
                Chairman of the Council of Ministers from 1941 until his death. Initially governing as part of a
                collective leadership, Stalin consolidated power to become a dictator by the 1930s. He codified his
                Leninist interpretation of Marxism as Marxism–Leninism, while the totalitarian political system he
                established became known as Stalinism.
