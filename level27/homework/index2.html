        <p>Bruce Lee[b] (born Lee Jun-fan;[c] November 27, 1940 – July 20, 1973) was a Hong Kong-American martial artist, actor, filmmaker, and philosopher. He was the founder of Jeet Kune Do, a hybrid martial arts philosophy which was formed from Lee's experiences in unarmed fighting and self-defense—as well as eclectic, Zen Buddhist and Taoist philosophies—as a new school of martial arts thought.[3][4] With a film career spanning Hong Kong and the United States,[5][6][7] Li is regarded as the first global Chinese film star and one of the most influential martial artists in the history of cinema.[8] Known for his roles in five feature-length martial arts films, Lee is credited with helping popularize martial arts films in the 1970s and promoting Hong Kong action cinema.[9][10]
